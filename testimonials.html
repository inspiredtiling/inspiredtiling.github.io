   						"I met James Caley (Watford Lettings) on a few occasions at a network meeting. As is the way, you build a relationship of trust with certain people, and when I was chatting with James about having my bathroom re-done at home, he recommended me to Nigel Singleton of Inspired Tiling, and said that Nigel’s work was very good, and that Nigel had previously done work for him in some of his lettings properties that he managed. Nigel came along to my home, and I was very impressed by his manner and his very obvious extreme pride in his work when he showed me pictures on his iPad of other jobs he had done, and the prep work that had gone into those jobs. We received a quote which seemed fair, and on a par with others we had obtained. However, we gave the job to Nigel on the strength of James' recommendation, and an instinct that we were making the right choice. Instinct proved correct - we have a new bathroom that we love, and that looks amazing. The job unfortunately turned out to be a real challenge for Nigel in that our plumbing waste system under the bath was wrong, the soil stack was a problem, and I had ordered the wrong size tiles, and every tile (bar one, literally) had to be cut to size by hand. Amazingly, at all times Nigel remained cheerful and upbeat. He arrived punctually at 8.30am every day and worked through with very little break time until 5pm. The work area and stairs were tidied and hoovered at the end of every day. Nigel even re-connected my old loo before he left, so that I would not have to come up and down the stairs a few times a night. (I am disabled you see and stairs cause me problems. Nigel was as respectful to my home, and took as much care of it as would have done if it was his own home. I have already recommended him to another local family who need a new bathroom - I hope he gets the job. I recommend Nigel wholeheartedly, and am grateful to James for the referral."<br />

None of the jobs were very big, but they were very fiddly and required the right tools and the right expertise to rectify them. I found the solution in Nigel from Inspired Tiling. He came to fix the jobs as soon as possible, despite their small nature, fitting them in when convenient for us and our busy routines, and most importantly did a great job at a very reasonable price.  Nigel really does go the extra mile finding just the right products for the job at hand. I have no hesitation in recommending Nigel to everyone I know for all their tiling needs "<br />
